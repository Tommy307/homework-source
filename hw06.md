1) Input device; Output device; Central Processing Unit(Control unit and Arithmetic/Logic unit);  
   Memory unit.  

2) 26 Bits  

3) CPU is consist of Control unit and Arithmetic/Logic unit ,which is not include cache, because cache can exit in many hardwares and softwares.  

4) The secondary Storage means those storages other than main memory ,which can store data eneb when the data are no longer being processed or when the mechine is turn down.  
There is hard disk drive ,magnetic tape , magnetic disk ,CDs and DVDs in my laptop.  

5)CPU  
   A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.    
   中央处理单元是电脑中的电子电路,可以执行电脑程序的指令中的基本算法,逻辑控制,输入输出等操作.电脑产业最少是从20世纪60年代就开始使用中央处理单元这种东西了.传统意义来说,CPU指的是处理器,更多的偏向于它的处理单元和控制单元,区别于外部元件如主存储器和输入输出电路等电脑的核心元件.  


  RAM  
  Random-access memory (RAM /ræm/) is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory, the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.   
  随机存取内存是电脑存储经常使用的数据和机械代码的一种形式.随机存取内存仪器让数据不管在内存的什么实际位置都可以几乎用同样的时间读取或写入.与此相反,有直接存取数据存储媒介比如硬盘,光盘,数字多功能光盘,和其它磁带或磁鼓存储器,数据的读取与写入时间极大程度地取决于数据在记录媒介上的实际位置,因为受到媒介的旋转速度和手臂移动速度的限制.  

    
  ROM  
  Read-only memory (ROM) is a type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices. Data stored in ROM can only be modified slowly, with difficulty, or not at all, so it is mainly used to store firmware (software that is closely tied to specific hardware, and unlikely to need frequent updates) or application software in plug-in cartridges.  
  只读存储器是一种用于电脑和其它电子设备的非易失性的内存.存储在ROM中的数据只能慢慢艰难地更改,或者根本就不能更改,所以它一般用来存储框架软件或插件里的应用软件.

  Bus  
  In computer architecture, a bus (a contraction of the Latin omnibus) is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols.   
  在电脑构造中,母线是在计算机的元件之间以及计算机之间进行传输数据的沟通系统.这个表示方法包含相关的硬件元件(电线,光导纤维......)和软件,包括交互法案. 
      
Parallel Computing   
Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time. There are several different forms of parallel computing: bit-level, instruction-level, data, and task parallelism.     
平行编码是一种许多计算机与处理器同时执行的计算方式.大的问题通常可以被分成许多小的可以同时解决的问题.现有许多种不同的平行计算方式:比特水平,指令水平,和任务水平.  
  
    
6)云计算就是把大家的系统资源和高质量的服务集合在一起,从而迅速有效的调用这些资源,收获最大的经济效益.
