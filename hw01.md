我的第一次作业
（1）Computer      [A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.]
                   [电脑呢，是一种可以通过程序设计被用来自主执行一系列算术或逻辑方程的一种仪器。现代计算机有能力去执行一系列广谱的操作--程序。这些程序使得计算机可以去执行超级广泛的一系列任务]


（2）Computer Science     [Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to, information. ]
                          [计算机科学是一门从理论，操作，工程上创造计算机设计与使用基础的学科。它让我们能够以科学的，专业的方式去计算，并应用和系统学习它的操作方法的可行性，结构，表达方式以及机械化从而使之成为获得，展示，发展，储存，交流信息的基础。]

(3)Software     [Computer software, or simply software, is a generic term that refers to a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built, that actually performs the work.]
                [电脑软件或简单的软件是一种指代一群告诉计算机如何去工作的数据或指令的一般术语，它与建造系统的实物硬件不同，它是真正执行任务的东西。]





(4)Software engineering       [Software engineering is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method]
                              [软件工程是一种用编程去改进软件的系统的方法。]






(5) Alan Turing           [Alan Mathison Turing was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a Turing mechine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. However, he was also a tragic figure: a hero who was never fully recognized in his home country during his lifetime due to his homosexuality.]
                          [艾伦.图灵是一个英国的计算机科学家，数学家，逻辑学家，密码分析学家，哲学家和理论生物学家。图灵在发展理论计算机科学领域很有影响力，他发明了一种叫图灵机的机器，而这个机器正是公认的普遍计算机的原型。图灵被广泛认为是理论计算机科学的人工智能之父。但他同样也是一个悲惨的形象，因为他是一个同性恋而使得他在有生之年从未被他的祖国完全接受。]
