我的第一次作业
（1）Computer      [A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.]
                   [电脑呢，是一种可以通过程序设计被用来自主执行一系列算术或逻辑方程的一种仪器。现代计算机有能力去执行一系列广谱的操作--程序。这些程序使得计算机可以去执行超级广泛的一系列任务]


（2）Computer Science     [Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to, information. ]
                          [计算机科学是一门从理论，操作，工程上创造计算机设计与使用基础的学科。它让我们能够以科学的，专业的方式去计算，并应用和系统学习它的操作方法的可行性，结构，表达方式以及机械化从而使之成为获得，展示，发展，储存，交流信息的基础。]

(3)Software     [Computer software, or simply software, is a generic term that refers to a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built, that actually performs the work.]
                [电脑软件或简单的软件是一种指代一群告诉计算机如何去工作的数据或指令的一般术语，它与建造系统的实物硬件不同，它是真正执行任务的东西。]





(4)Software engineering       [Software engineering is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method]
                              [软件工程是一种用编程去改进软件的系统的方法。]






(5) Alan Turing           [Alan Mathison Turing was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a Turing mechine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. However, he was also a tragic figure: a hero who was never fully recognized in his home country during his lifetime due to his homosexuality.]
                          [艾伦.图灵是一个英国的计算机科学家，数学家，逻辑学家，密码分析学家，哲学家和理论生物学家。图灵在发展理论计算机科学领域很有影响力，他发明了一种叫图灵机的机器，而这个机器正是公认的普遍计算机的原型。图灵被广泛认为是理论计算机科学的人工智能之父。但他同样也是一个悲惨的形象，因为他是一个同性恋而使得他在有生之年从未被他的祖国完全接受。]







(6)Moore’s law             [Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit, and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade.In 1975,looking forward to the next decade, he revised the forecast to doubling every two years.The period is often quoted as 18 months because of a prediction by Intel executive David House ]
                            [摩尔定律是一个观察结果，它发现密集集成电路中的晶体管数目每两年会变为原来的两倍。这个观察结果由伽顿·摩尔命名，他是飞兆半导体和因特网创造人之一，他的1965年的报告指出每个集成电路的元件每年都会翻倍，并且这样的增长至少会持续到下个世纪。在1975年，展望下个世纪，他修改了自己每两年翻倍的预想。这个周期因为因特网经营的大卫房子的预报往往是18个月]
